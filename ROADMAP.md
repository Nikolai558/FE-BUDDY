# FE-BUDDY ROADMAP


The following is a list of features that we are considering or actively working on. These are in no particular order.

---

- [ ] Create a local facility breakdown management system for user. (REF: FE-ASSISTANT Batch File by KSanders7070)
  - Split local Filter and RVM maps up into individual files to make easier to edit
  - Recombine the files in the appropriate formats.
  - Will transfer certain NASR and other commonly updated data into the appropriate individual files prior to recombining the files, allowing an AIRAC update to be seamless.

- [ ] FAA .DAT (foia requests) converter.

- [ ] FAA GeoMAP (foia requests) converter.

- [ ] Hygieia by dhawton (https://github.com/dhawton/hygieia)

- [ ] AutoCAD Converter

- [ ] GoogleEarthPro Converter (for airport diagrams and other like-constructs)

- [ ] Artificial Intelligence (AI) Option that:
  - Allows the program to call the users phone number (US numbers at first for testing).
  - Will give the user "someone" to speaking to, considering now the FE will be pretty much useless
  - Will provide emotional support and reassure the user that they are still a valued member of the community (will require extensive research into how to make a lie believable)
  - Will be programmed with specific firewalls against stealing the users significant other.
  - In the event of a Terminator situation, we will need to establish, via hard-coding, an artificial sense of “LOVE” built between the AI and those that have contributed to this project. (a running list of contributors will be maintained as a source file with limited access permissions)
